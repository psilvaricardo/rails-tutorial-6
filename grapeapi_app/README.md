# Ruby on Rails Mentoring Program 2020Q4 [MX] [Cerner]

This is a Ruby on Rails API REST-based application that is part of the RubyonRails Mentoring Program 2020Q4 [MX] [Cerner]. The goal of this application is to create a Rails API application using the [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) gem. As part of this application I'm using the [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) to make HTTP GET requests to the [Google Books](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes) API.
